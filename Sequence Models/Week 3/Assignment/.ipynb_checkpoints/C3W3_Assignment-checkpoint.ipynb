    "\n",
    "- All cells are frozen except for the ones where you need to submit your solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can add new cells to experiment but these will be omitted by the grader, so don't rely on newly created cells to host your solution code, use the provided places for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can add the comment # grade-up-to-here in any graded cell to signal the grader that it must only evaluate up to that point. This is helpful if you want to check if you are on the right track even if you are not done with the whole assignment. Be sure to remember to delete the comment afterwards!\n",
    "\n",
    "- To submit your notebook, save it and then click on the blue submit button at the beginning of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, you should be familiar with Tensorflow and know how to make use of it to define your model. We will start this homework by asking you to create a vocabulary in a similar way as you did in the previous assignments. After this, you will build a classifier that will allow you to identify whether two questions are the same or not. \n",

    "<img src = \"./img/meme.png\" style=\"width:550px;height:300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your model will take in the two questions, which will be transformed into tensors, each tensor will then go through embeddings, and after that an LSTM. Finally you will compare the outputs of the two subnetworks using cosine similarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before taking a deep dive into the model, you will start by importing the data set, and exploring it a bit.\n"

Because of the implementation of the loss function you will see in the next section, you are not going to have the cosine similarity as output of your Siamese network, but rather $v_1$ and $v_2$. You will add the cosine distance step once you reach the classification step. \n",
    "\n",
    "To train the model, you will use the triplet loss (explained below). This loss makes use of a baseline (anchor) input that is compared to a positive (truthy) input and a negative (falsy) input. The (cosine) distance from the baseline input to the positive input is minimized, and the distance from the baseline input to the negative  input is maximized. Mathematically, you are trying to maximize the following.\n",

Positive examples are questions $q1_i$, and $q2_i$, while all the other combinations $q1_i$, $q2_j$ ($i\\neq j$), are considered negative examples. The loss will be composed of two terms. One term utilizes the mean of all the non duplicates, the second utilizes the *closest negative*. Our loss expression is then:\n",

    "- As this will be run inside Tensorflow, use all operation supplied by `tf.math` or `tf.linalg`, instead of `numpy` functions. You will also need to explicitly use `tf.shape` to get the batch size from the inputs. This is to make it compatible with the Tensor inputs it will receive when doing actual training and testing. \n",
    "- Use [`tf.linalg.matmul`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/linalg/matmul) to calculate the similarity matrix $v_2v_1^T$ of dimension `batch_size` x `batch_size`. \n",
    "- Take the score of the duplicates on the diagonal with [`tf.linalg.diag_part`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/linalg/diag_part). \n",
    "- Use the `TensorFlow` functions [`tf.eye`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/eye) and [`tf.math.reduce_max`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/reduce_max) for the identity matrix and the maximum respectively. "

    "We'll describe the algorithm using a detailed example. Below, $V_1$, $V_2$ are the output of the normalization blocks in our model. Here you will use a `batch_size` of 4 and a `d_model of 3`. As explained in lecture, the input questions, Q1, Q2 are arranged so that corresponding inputs are duplicates while non-corresponding entries are not. The outputs will have the same pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"./img/tripletLossexample.png\" style=\"width:817px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This testcase arranges the outputs, $V_1$,$V_2$, to highlight different scenarios. Here, the first two outputs $V_1[0]$, $V_2[0]$ match exactly, so the model is generating the same vector for Q1[0] and Q2[0] inputs. The second pair of outputs, circled in orange, differ greatly on one of the values, so the transformation is not quite the same for these questions. Next, you have examples $V_1[3]$ and $V_2[3]$, which match almost exactly. Finally, $V_1[4]$ and $V_2[4]$, circled in purple, are set to be exactly opposite, being 180 degrees from each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to compute the cosine similarity matrix or `score` in the code. As explained in the lectures, this is $$V_2 V_1^T.$$This is generated with `tf.linalg.matmul`. Since matrix multiplication is not commutative, the order in which you pass the arguments is important. If you want columns to represent different questions in Q1 and rows to represent different questions in Q2, as seen in the video, then you need to compute $V_2 V_1^T$. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"./img/tripletLoss2.png\" style=\"width:900px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The clever arrangement of inputs creates the data needed for positive *and* negative examples without having to run all pair-wise combinations. Because Q1[n] is a duplicate of only Q2[n], other combinations are explicitly created negative examples or *Hard Negative* examples. The matrix multiplication efficiently produces the cosine similarity of all positive/negative combinations as shown above on the left side of the diagram. 'Positive' are the results of duplicate examples (cells shaded in green) and 'negative' are the results of explicitly created negative examples (cells shaded in blue). The results for our test case are as expected, $V_1[0]\\cdot V_2[0]$ and $V_1[3]\\cdot V_2[3]$ match producing '1', and '0.99' respectively, while the other 'positive' cases don't match quite right. Note also that the $V_2[2]$ example was set to match $V_1[3]$, producing a not so good match at `score[2,2]` and an undesired 'negative' case of a '1', shown in grey. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the similarity matrix (`score`) you can begin to implement the loss equations. First, you can extract $cos(A,P)$ by utilizing `tf.linalg.diag_part`. The goal is to grab all the green entries in the diagram above. This is `positive` in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will create the *closest_negative*. This is the nonduplicate entry in $V_2$ that is closest to (has largest cosine similarity) to an entry in $V_1$, but still has smaller cosine similarity than the positive example. For example, consider row 2 in the score matrix. This row has the cosine similarity between $V_2[2]$ and all four vectors in $V_1$. In this case, the largest value in the off-diagonal is`score[2,3]`$=V_2[3]\\cdot V1[2]$, which has a score of 1. However, since 1 is grater than the similarity for the positive example, this is *not* the *closest_negative*. For this particular row, the *closes_negative* will have to be `score[2,1]=0.36`. This is the maximum value of the 'negative' entries, which are smaller than the 'positive' example.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this, you need to pick the maximum entry on a row of `score`, ignoring the 'positive'/green entries, and 'negative/blue entry greater that the 'positive' one. To avoid selecting these entries, you can make them larger negative numbers. For this, you can create a mask to identify these two scenarios, multiply it by 2.0 and subtract it out of `scores`. To create the mask, you need to check if the cell is diagonal by computing `tf.eye(batch_size) ==1`, or if the non-diagonal cell is greater than the diagonal with `(negative_zero_on_duplicate > tf.expand_dims(positive, 1)`. Remember that `positive` already has the diagonal values. Now you can use `tf.math.reduce_max`, row by row (axis=1), to select the maximum which is `closest_negative`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll create *mean_negative*. As the name suggests, this is the mean of all the 'negative'/blue values in `score` on a row by row basis. You can use `tf.linalg.diag` to create a diagonal matrix, where the diagonal matches `positive`, and just subtract it from `score` to get just the 'negative' values. This is `negative_zero_on_duplicate` in the code. Compute the mean by using `tf.math.reduce_sum` on `negative_zero_on_duplicate` for `axis=1` and divide it by `(batch_size - 1)`. This is `mean_negative`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can compute loss using the two equations above and `tf.maximum`. This will form `triplet_loss1` and `triplet_loss2`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`triplet_loss` is the `tf.math.reduce_sum` of the sum of the two individual losses.\n"
